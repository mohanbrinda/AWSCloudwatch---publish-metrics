#create an instance and role to give write access to the instance
#ssh to the instance and start pushing some data in order to graph

ssh -i key.pem ubuntu@xxxxxxxx.xxx.compute.amazonaws.compute

#update and install awscli

sudo -i
apt-get update

#generate some random numbers between 1 and 1000 using shuff command and puh it o cloudwatch
#A graph will be presented with given data points

shuf -i 1-1000 -n 1

#Put the datapoints into cloudwatch using the following command the backtix symbol in the command
#will be replaced with the results in the command

#Setup a cron job to push random number every monute to graph

#edit the file for adding 5 (min, hour, day etc.)nd paste the command for generating random numbers
